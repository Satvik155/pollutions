    <header><u><i>TYPES OF POLLUTION</i></u></header>
    <main>As stated before, there are different types of pollution, which are either caused by natural events (like forest fires) or by man-made activities (like cars, factories, nuclear wastes, etc.) These are further classified into the following types of pollution:

        <h1>• Air Pollution  </h1>
        <h2>• Water Pollution</h2>
        <h3>• Soil Pollution</h3>
        <h4>• Noise Pollution</h4>
        Besides these 4 types of pollution, other types exist such as light pollution, thermal pollution and radioactive pollution. The latter is much rarer than other types, but it is the deadliest.</main>
